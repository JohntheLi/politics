# Politicus

Personalized political news feed.
Looking to publish to Google Play Store and App Store by mid-September.

## Features:

  * Modules: Polical news feed consists of modules that include relevant news articles, congressional bills, and congressional tweets.
  * Categorization: Naive Bayes classifier used to categorize tweets and bills into modules and order them in the feed based on user preference.
  * Chips: Chips (https://material.io/components/chips/#choice-chips) for manually selecting topics.
  * Liking: Instagram-esque liking functionality (double tap to like/unlike). Liked items are saved locally and can be viewed later.
