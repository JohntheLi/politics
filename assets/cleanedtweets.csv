act is a critic step in fix our democraci so we can address the challeng we face. the bill protect vote rights, make elect offici account & end the domin of big $ in our polit 
instead, it paid for by wealthi tax cheat and corpor lawbreak 
posit reform measures, would it be worth it to at least make a start at correct some of the most egregi impedi to fair elect such as gerrymand

wa the definit sellout�tak by far the most out-of-st corpor bribe but whine about the nerv of voter make small dollar donat 
equal vote right should not still be an ongo issue. local activist agre enough is enough 
would the bill allow non-citizen to vote as some claim? 
wealthi donor more profit, even if that mean support more coal fire power plants.th republican parti is pro-capit and anti-american. it time for our politician to resist big corp dollars. 
protect our right to vote, crack down on corruption, and support campaign financ reform. keep fight for us! 
democraci work better for all american by take corpor monei out of politics, protect vote rights, and more.

too mani american have lost faith in our government. that chang thi month when a pass hr1, the forthepeopl act, which would make it easier to vote and harder to bui elections. 
basic the whole idea is to do thi whole packag of good govern reform that will restor faith in the institution.
